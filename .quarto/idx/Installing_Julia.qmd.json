The Julia compiler\n2. A code editor\n\nIt is also recommended that you consider a few additional tools, although they are optional.\n\n## Windows Terminal\nWhile not strictly required, installing Windows Terminal is highly recommended. Windows Terminal is a much more modern replacement for the venerable Windows command prompt. It has the same features as a typical Linux terminal and will make your experience of the Julia REPL a lot more pleasant.\n\nIf you are going to use Windows Terminal, install it first, from the Microsoft Store. If you then install Julia or Git, they will automatically configure themselves in Windows Terminal.\n\n## The Julia compiler\nThere are several ways to install Julia on your machine, whether or not you have local administrator rights. Julia will happily run from a user-only installation, or you can install it for all users on your machine. You can also use a portable (not installed) version.\n\n### Direct download and install\nYou can download and install Julia from the official [homepage](www.julialang.org). The 64-bit version is recommended, unless you have a specific reason to want a 32-bit version.\n\n### Microsoft Store\nThe recommended way of installing Julia, if this is an option for you, is via the Microsoft Store. Installing Julia this way actually installs JuliaUp, an installation manager for Julia.\n\nJuliaUp allows you to have multiple installations of Julia, e.g. the current release version as well as the current development (pre-release) version.\n\nYou can easily switch between them with a single command-line instruction. JuliaUp will also automatically keep your Julia installation updated when a new version is released.\n\n## Visual Studio Code\nThe recommended code editor for Julia is Visual Studio Code (VSCode). This is a Microsoft project that is free and partially open-sourced. You can download and install it from the official [homepage](code.visualstudio.com) or via the Microsoft Store.\n\nVSCode will prompt you to install updates, so there is less reason to want to install this from the Microsoft Store. New releases are typically available monthly.\n\n### The Julia Add-in for VSCode\nVSCode is a general-purpose code editor. To use it with Julia, you need to install the Julia add-in from within VSCode. You can also install Python, R, C, Fortran and many other add-ins.\n\nIf you are adventurous, you can install the *insider version* of the Julia add-in, but this is not recommended for for typical end-users.\n\nThe Julia add-in not only links Julia to VSCode seamlessly, it also provides a debugger and many other tools, like compiling system images for quicker start-up.\n\nSee the [documentation](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/) for more information.\n\n### Other Useful Add-ins\nSome add-ins recommended for everyday use are:\n- Edit CSV\n- Rainbow CSV\n- SandDance for VSCode\n- SVG\n\nEdit CSV allows for easy editing CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files rigth within VSCode, so you don't need to go back to Excel for small edits.\n\nRainbow CSV color-codes the columns in CSV files, making it much easier to work with them.\n\nSandDance generates plots of the data in a CSV for quick data exploration.\n\nSVG allows you to preview SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files inside VSCode. Most of the plotting packages can save plots as SVG files, which is recommended, since you can zoom in or out infinitly without loss of quality. Microsoft Office can include SVG files in, e.g. Word and PowerPoint.\n\nFor writing technical documents that include running code, e.g. to generate the plots, and to publish these to web pages, .PDF or DOCX documents, among others, consider Quarto (this will require the installation of the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) program as well as the VSCode add-in)\n\n## Fonts\nJulia can make full use of Unicode fonts. This means you can use greek letters, emojis or anything else as variable names. Julia will also use common mathematical symbols, althoug there are alternatives for those who prefer to stick to ASCII. For examples:\n\n```julia\nmass = 1.23\nvol = 2.56\n\nρ = mass/vol\nif 0.1 <= ρ <= 1.0\n    if ρ ≈ 0.48\n        println(\"Correct\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis reads a lot more like what you would normally write out by hand, e.g. using `ρ` instead of `rho`. In the place of `≈`, you can use the `isapprox()` function, which has a few more options.\n\nThe use of `<=` is entirely optional as well. You simply type a `<` followed by `=`, and with the correct fonts installed, this will automatically be rendered as `<=`. If you don't like that, just change the option in VSCode that allows use of font ligatures.\n\nTo make use of the Unicode abilities in you need a font installed that can handle ligatures and has a decent coverage of Unicode symbols. The following are recommended\n- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)\n- [JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/)\n- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)\n\nVSCode uses fall-back fonts, so if the first font specified in the settings does not include the character it should render, it will look in the next font until it finds the glyph, or runs out of fonts to look in. You can therefore install all three these fonts and then add them to the from of the list of specified fonts.\n\nYou use Unicode characters my typing, e.g. `\\rho` and pressing the `<tab>` key. If you find a character in someone's code that you don't know how to type, simply copy it and paste it next to the help prompt in Julia:\n\n```julia\nhelp?> ℱ\n\"ℱ\" can be typed by \\scrF<tab>\n```\n\n## Git\nGit is a version control software. No, more accurately, Git is THE version control software. You do not need to use Git, but it will most certainly make your life a lot easier if you are either working in a team or working on large projects. \n\nGit is integrated into VSCode, but it is often handy to have the command-line version. You can get it from the Git [homepage](https://git-scm.com/). Like Julia and VSCode, Git is free and open-sourced."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Installing_Julia.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"cosmo","monofont":"JetBrains Mono","title":"Installing Julia"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
