This is an introductory course to using the [Julia programming language](www.julialang.org) for technical programming.

It assumes some nominal programming background and knowledge of the engineering sciences and numerical methods to fully appreciate the examples.

This course is **NOT** meant to turn the reader into an expert in either Julia. or technical modelling. It is meant to get you up and running in a reasonably short time, so you can start learning by doing. More detailed references are given in each section for additional information.

Once the reader is comfortable with the material, it is recommended to also work through [Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML): Methods and Applications](https://book.sciml.ai/), which is a more advanced, and much more comprehensive document.
